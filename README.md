#  Ethon [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/typhoeus/ethon.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/typhoeus/ethon)

In the greek mythology Ethon is a gigantic eagle the son of Typhoeus and Echidna. So much for the history.
In the modern world Ethon is a very basic libcurl wrapper using ffi.

## Caution

This is __alpha__!

## Installation

With bundler:

    gem "ethon", :git => "https://github.com/typhoeus/ethon.git", :branch => "master"

## Usage

Making the first request is realy simple:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new(:url => "www.google.de")
easy.prepare
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```

You have access to various options like following redirects:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new(:url => "www.google.com", :follow_location => true)
easy.prepare
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```
Once you're done you can look at the response code and body:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new(:url => "www.google.de")
easy.prepare
easy.perform
easy.response_code
#=> 200
easy.response_body
#=> "<!doctype html><html ..."
```

## Http

In order to make life easier there are some helpers for doing http requests:

```ruby
easy = Ethon::Easy.new
easy.http_request("www.google.de", :get, { :params => {:a => 1} })
easy.prepare
easy.perform
#=> :ok

easy = Ethon::Easy.new
easy.http_request("www.google.de", :post, { :params => { :a => 1 }, :body => { :b => 2 } })
easy.prepare
easy.perform
#=> :ok
```

This really handy when doing requests since you don't have to care about setting
everything up correct.
